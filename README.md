# Association-between-IDO2-and-Lactic-Acid-
Analyzed the association between IDO2 and Lactic Acid. Lactic Acid (a.k.a. Lactate) is a by-product of anaerobic metabolism, or metabolism when there is not sufficient oxygen present to support aerobic metabolism. Hypothesis: Elevated levels of IDO2 are associated with elevated levels of lactic acid.
